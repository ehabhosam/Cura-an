1|1|In the name of Allah, most benevolent, ever-merciful.
1|2|ALL PRAISE BE to Allah, Lord of all the worlds,
1|3|Most beneficent, ever-merciful,
1|4|King of the Day of Judgement.
1|5|You alone we worship, and to You alone turn for help.
1|6|Guide us (O Lord) to the path that is straight,
1|7|The path of those You have blessed, Not of those who have earned Your anger, nor those who have gone astray.

2|2|This is The Book free of doubt and involution, a guidance for those who preserve themselves from evil and follow the straight path,
2|3|Who believe in the Unknown and fulfil their devotional obligations, and spend in charity of what We have given them;
2|4|Who believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed to those before you, and are certain of the Hereafter.
2|5|They have found the guidance of their Lord and will be successful.
